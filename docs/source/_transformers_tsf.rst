5. Summary: 
--------------------

(1): This paper aims to systematically review the development and performance of Transformer schemes for time series modeling, as Transformer has shown great modeling ability for long-range dependencies and interactions in sequential data and thus are appealing to time series modeling.

(2): The past methods related to deep learning for time series have been surveyed, but there is no comprehensive survey for Transformers in time series. The paper proposes a new taxonomy from perspectives of both network modifications and application domains for time series Transformers. The motivation is to provide practical guidelines on how to effectively use Transformers for time series modeling.

(3): The research methodology proposed in this paper is to summarize the adaptations and modifications that have been made to Transformers in order to accommodate the challenges in time series analysis, and categorize time series Transformers based on common tasks including forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification. Empirically, the authors perform robust analysis, model size analysis, and seasonal-trend decomposition analysis to study how Transformers perform in time series.

(4): The methods in this paper are applied to various time series tasks, such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification, and the paper concludes by discussing possible future directions for time series Transformers. The performance of the methods is well supported by the experimental analysis, and the paper provides useful research guidance for the time series community.

6. Methods:
