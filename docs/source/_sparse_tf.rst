5. Summary:
--------------------

(1): This paper aims to address the limitations of previous methods for sequence modeling, which require significant time and memory for longer sequences. 

(2): Past methods, such as architectures based on CNNs or autoregressive models, face challenges in modeling complex, long-range dependencies and require significant depth and computational resources. The proposed approach introduces sparse factorizations of the attention matrix, reduces memory usage through recomputation, and uses fast attention kernels to train deeper networks. 

(3): The research methodology involves introducing various modifications to the existing transformer architecture, including sparse factorizations, recomputations, and faster attention kernels, to address the limitations of previous methods. The proposed approach is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR10, and ImageNet-64 datasets and in generating unconditional samples with global coherence and great diversity. 

(4): The sparse transformer models can effectively address long-range dependencies and generate long sequences with a reduced memory and computational cost. The performance achieved by the proposed methods on various tasks supports their goals of improving sequence modeling using sparse transformers.

6. Conclusion:
--------------------

(1): This work is significant in proposing a new approach to sequence modeling using sparse transformers that can effectively address the limitations of previous methods in modeling long sequences with reduced computational cost.

(2): Innovation point: The paper introduces several modifications to the existing transformer architecture to improve sequence modeling using sparse factorizations, recomputations, and faster attention kernels. (3): Performance: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in density modeling and unconditional sample generation on Enwik8, CIFAR10, and ImageNet-64 datasets with global coherence and great diversity. (4): Workload: The sparse transformers require significantly fewer operations and memory usage while attaining better or equivalent performance to standard transformers, making them highly efficient for sequence modeling tasks.
