=====


Optimal Execution 
----------------


For example:

>>> import gym_exchange
>>> gym_exchange.make()

Optimal Scheduling with Predicted Trading Volume
---------------
* In vwap replicate strategies, split the task into smaller sizes according to the predicted trading volume.

Order-flow Generating 
---------
* Mathematical Perspective: Order flow as a general spatial point process
* Time-series Forecasting for Order Flow
* Order Flow Generating by Large Language Models

Representation Learning
