Future Research Topics
=====


Optimal Execution 
----------------


For example:

>>> import gym_exchange
>>> gym_exchange.make()

Optimal Scheduling with Predicted Trading Volume
---------------
* In vwap replicate strategies, split the task into smaller sizes according to the predicted trading volume.

Order-flow Generating 
---------
* Mathematical Perspective: Order flow as a general spatial point process
* Time-series Forecasting for Order Flow
* Order Flow Generating by Large Language Models


Representation Learning
----------
* Representation Learning for the States


Price Impact Research through Market Clearing
----------
* Mathematical Perspective: Market clearing as a deterministic operator acting on the distributions of buy and sell orders.
* Calculate the price impact without the assumption of impact function


Indirect Market Impact
----------------------
* Agent's Impact on Triggering the Modification of other Agents
    * different from the price impact, which is the direct maret impact.


Unsupervised Environment Design
----------
* Adversarial Learning by the differentiable environment
