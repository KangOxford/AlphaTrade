Dynamic Calibration of Order Flow Models with Generative Adversarial Networks
================================================

Summary:
-----

   * The study discusses a limit order book (LOB) and a Poisson order flow model for it.

   * The past models, including limit order submission, cancellation, and execution, had shortcomings in order to predict the queue size and the order arrivals at different price levels. The approach of this paper, which proposes a Poisson order flow model, is well motivated and uses independent Poisson processes for different order types.

   * The research methodology involves the calibration of Poisson order flow models on short-term limit order book data, with additional information given by the set of conditioning variables: session data, a variable depending on the current time and day of the week, and a variable describing the current LOB state.

   * The study aims to generate synthetic order flows with GANs, which can contain additional patterns compared to a model calibrated on historical data only. The GANs generate realistic patterns for the tick frequency, the spread-imbalance histograms, and the distribution of limit order queues. The synthetic order flow generated by the models matches the stylized facts in the data.
