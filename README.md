## Week_3
* **Market Simulation Implemention and Benchmark Seeking**. 
  </br>`2022.May.09, 11:00AM~12:15Noon`, with `Prof. Hambly`, `Prof. Foerster`, `Huining Yang`, and `Dr. Christian` at `Mathematical Institute`.
  * `Setting_1` Queue-reactive model, with quantity solved by `Monte Carlo` simulation to the stochastic process, or `High(2N) dimensional PDEs`, solved by `Fourie Neural Operater`(2020)
  * `#TODO` This week
    * Implement PPO agents in the setting of this paper: [`Setting_2` Get Real: Realism Metrics for Robust Limit Order Book Market Simulations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpmPRC4Wm32QfS8uvjhY66T0AQTSu6LM/view?usp=sharing) ,with no need to turn to the GPU version unless coming across the situation we really need the speed. 
    * Find the Benchmark for the `Setting_2`.
  * `Setting_3` RL agents with preset reward functions(parameters calibrated from historical data), rather than fixed action policies.
  * `Setting_4` Generative Models
    * [Generating Realistic Stock Market Order Streams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zX1tQfpPaMCSeK7KWcx8x2UhSRsvbQYh/view?usp=sharing) 
    * [Deep Learning of the Order Flow for Modelling Price Formation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ohi-dCJf7uiGsYSh8x6Jkd_eYr0sFr2D/view?usp=sharing)
  * Sheduled meeting : 
    * `May.17 04:00P.M, Next Tuesday` with `Prof. Hambly`, and `Huining Yang`.
    * Discuss with  `Prof. Foerster` via email after the meeting.
    * `May.23 11:00A.M.` with  `Prof. Hambly`, `Prof. Foerster`, `Huining Yang`, and `Dr. Christian`.
  * Data requirements
    * `Pending` [Lobster](https://lobsterdata.com/) data from Prof. Hambly
    * `Pending` LOB data from Huining Yang
